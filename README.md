# Deduction rulebook

These two rules:
 * X, -X |- F (special case of modus ponens)
 * F |- X (ex falso quodlibet)
 
Have been replaced by this rule:
 * X, -X |- Y (ex falso quodlibet)
 
By doing so, we never need to mention F, and the user does not have to know that -X is equivalent to X > F
